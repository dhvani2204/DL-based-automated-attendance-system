# DL-based-automated-attendance-system

Even in this digital era, it has been seen that many institutes and schools still rely on pen-paper based attendance which takes a lot of lecture time and effort by the lecturers often leading to errors and chaos. Through this project, we aim to empower institutions and educators with a fully automated attendance system using the power of Deep Learning. All the faculty would have to do is click/upload a picture of the classroom after the lecture, and they would be displayed with the list of students present in the class. We have used AlexNet Architecture for facial recognition of an individual person's face. For extraction of multiple images of the students, we have used harcascade classifier which would segment the faces from the class picture and then send them to the model for facial recognition, one by one. We have created an app using android studio called 'TrulyPresent' for enhanced user experience. The list of students displayed can further be stored in databases to store daily and monthly attendance hence completely digitalizing the attendance process.
